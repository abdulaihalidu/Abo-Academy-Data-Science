#### The project description is as folow:

Mini Project 1 – Where do I fly next? 
 
Note:  
The  mini  projects  are  individual  assignments.  You  could  and  it  is 
encouraged to brainstorm the assignments with your classmates, but you 
need to have individual codes and reports. All written reports and codes 
are going to be checked for plagiarism. 
 
 
Task description  
 
Step1- Webscraping 
  
•  Choose a city in the world to ﬂy to from Helsinki, for a trip, on the condition that 
there are at least 50 ﬂights available to choose from; 
•  Choose the date for the trip; 
•  Scrape the data about the ﬂights from Helsinki to that city from three booking websites 
of your choosing, e.g., Skyscanner, Kayak, Momondo, Expedia, Booking.com etc.  
•  What are the challenges in scraping the data? How do you store the scraped data for 
a further easy use?  
 
 
 Step 2 – _Data processing  
•  What are the data processing steps for having a proper dataset to be used in the next 
step?  
 
 
 Step 3 – Exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
 
Use the appropriate visualisation method to provide a comprehensive EDA, e.g., price ranges, 
number of stops, airlines, departure and arrival times, duration of the ﬂight, layover time (if 
the ﬂight is not direct), etc.  
 
 
Step 4 – Interaction with the user 
Your code should be able to perform the following task to give the user the list of “ideal” 
ﬂight to the chosen city: 
 
•  The user inputs certain preferences for the ﬂight, e.g., price ranges, trip duration ranges 
(how long from departure to destination), whether the ﬂight is direct or has one or 
more stops (if it has stops then layover duration), ﬂight company from available options 
etc.  
•  The user can choose the criteria based on which the ﬂights should be sorted. 
•  The code returns the sorted list of all ﬂights based on the above criteria.  
•  The user should be able to input the earliest convenient time of departure on the 
departure day from your list, maximum travel time (trip duration from departure to 
destination) and choose a preferred airline company from available options and get 
the following information:  
 o  Cheapest ﬂight for the preselected data with the following details:  
§  Total duration of the ﬂight? 
§  Whether the cheapest ﬂight is direct or has one or more stops?  
§  If it is not direct how long is the layover and in which city? If it has 
multiple stops, print all layovers.  
§  Type of the aircraft where available, etc.  
 
o  Fastest ﬂight for the preselected data with the same details as above.  
 
Reporting  
 
Write a scientiﬁc report which includes:  
•  Introduction (What is the problem you are solving?)  
•  Data collection (What is the data you are collecting and what is your method 
of choice?)  
•  Data analysis (How did you visualise the data and how do you interpret the 
data  visualisation? What are the interesting observations you could report?)  
•  Conclusion (What were the “scientiﬁc” bottlenecks? How did you overcome 
them?)
